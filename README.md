# Ztype
This typing game in python is one of my high school projects that I was really passionate about.
It is a space shooter game that makes your typing practice more fun by associating a word for each invading spaceship, depending on their difficulty. They come in waves and each wave is more difficult than the previous one. It's a fun little game that you can have a good time playing.
